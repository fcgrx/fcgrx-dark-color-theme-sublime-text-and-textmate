"fcgrx dark" color theme for Sublime Text and Textmate
======================================================

A color theme for Sublime Text (and TextMate), featuring scopes for ExpressionEngine tags.

Pairs well with my overhauled and expanded syntax highlighting grammar:

https://github.com/fcgrx/ExpressionEngine2-Sublime-Text-3-Bundle

Installation
------------

To install this theme in Sublime Text:

1) create a folder called "Color Schemes" in your Packages/User directory

2) move "fcgrx_dark.tmTheme" from this repository into that folder

3) restart Sublime Text and then choose Sublime Text > Preferences > Color Scheme > User > Color Schemes > fcgrx_dark

Modification
------------

Not all scopes defined in this theme have a color or style assigned. That's a matter of personal taste. To customize this theme, I recommend this excellent online theme editor:

Enjoy!
